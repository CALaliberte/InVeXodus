# *InVeXodus®* - Skills for Tomorrow, Today

## Why we exist

[*InVeXodus®*](https://www.invexodus.org/) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit founded in 2024 for the purpose of workforce development and economic mobility. The name *InVeXodus®* combines "innovative" and "exodus", reflecting our mission to leverage innovative technologies to lead communities out of economic instability by equipping them with essential skills to thrive in the rapidly changing workforce. Our approach is heavily influenced by advancing STEM initiatives for everyone.

This mission is fueled by the stories of our founding members. *InVeXodus* was founded by three individuals while incarcerated in different prisons across Maine, and one individual who is formerly incarcerated. Their shared experiences highlighted the underlying issues leading to incarceration and the barriers faced upon release. Meaningful employment is crucial to participate in society, yet barriers to employment exist for many people for various reasons. Empathizing with this struggle, we took action by providing relevant skill development in modern industries. Our vision is to foster thriving communities by helping people secure meaningful employment.

Below is a snapshot of how we think, including a link to our previously-internal [operating manual](https://github.com/CALaliberte/InVeXodus/blob/main/1%20-%20Manual.md) — with many details on how we work.

## Why our website is on GitHub

Inspired by [Bloomberg Beta's](https://github.com/Bloomberg-Beta/Manual?tab=readme-ov-file) innovative approach, we chose to host our website on GitHub to embrace transparency and collaboration. This platform allows us to openly share our processes, decisions, and financials, aligning with our core value of transparency.

At *InVeXodus®*, our core values guide our actions and decisions, ensuring we remain true to our mission and vision:

* Integrity - Acting with honesty and upholding ethical standards
* Transparency - Openly sharing processes, decisions, and financials
* Equanimity - Fostering a balanced and supportive environment
* Innovation - Seeking creative solutions to social challenges
* Stewardship - Managing resources responsibly and sustainably

By hosting our website on GitHub, we aim to foster a culture of openness and collaboration, inviting our community and stakeholders to engage with us and contribute to our mission. This approach not only enhances our transparency but also allows us to innovate continuously and adapt to the evolving needs of the communities we serve.
